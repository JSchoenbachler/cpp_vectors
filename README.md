# cpp_vectors
 
 This repository is to create my own vector math library for 2 and 3 dimensional vectors.

 Vector coordinates are be represented as left-handed and Y-up, and includes the following static references:


 * (0, 0) - Vector2::zero

 * (1, 1) - Vector2::one
 
 * (1, 0) - Vector2::right
 
 * (0, 1) - Vector2::up
 
 * (-1, 0) - Vector2::left
 
 * (0, -1) - Vector2::down
 
 * (0, 0, 0) - Vector3::zero
 
 * (1, 1, 1) - Vector3::one
 
 * (1, 0, 0) - Vector3::right
 
 * (0, 1, 0) - Vector3::up
 
 * (0, 0, 1) - Vector3::forward
 
 * (-1, 0, 0) - Vector3::left
 
 * (0, -1, 0) - Vector3::down
 
 * (0, 0, -1) - Vector3::back
